Finite Markov chains are network models commonly used to represent stochastic processes as varied as animal movement within an ecosystem 🦜🌴, the fluctuating status of financial markets 💸📈, and DNA folding to its functional structure 🧬🦠. DISCOTRESS is a software package to analyse the dynamics of finite Markov chains, including exact computation of dynamical properties and simulation of pathways on the network.

DISCOTRESS is specifically designed to deal with Markov chains featuring a comparatively slow event. This is a common feature of realistic dynamical models - for instance, daily trading leads to moderate market fluctuations 💱 and a dramatic stock market crash is improbable on any one day 📉. For Markov chains exhibiting rare event dynamics, standard algorithms to compute dynamical quantities are numerically unstable, and standard algorithms to simulate pathways are severely inefficient. DISCOTRESS includes a suite of advanced algorithms that negate these problems. See https://github.com/danieljsharpe/DISCOTRESS to get started!

DISCOTRESS is developed by me, Daniel J. Sharpe. Currently, I am in the final year of my PhD at the University of Cambridge. Much of my work deals with the theory of Markov chains, but I am also interested in applications, especially to the modeling of ecological and economic systems.
